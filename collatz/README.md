Started with the basic math problem. 

Added variables inside the problem to not worry about the files for now.

Had the problem running endlessly so I had to fix the loop by adding variable z and assigning x to z for the while loop.

Added variable "count" to count the numbers in both ifs which was wrong and then I changed it to be in the end of the if statement.

Figured that one count variable is not enough so I added another variable "maxcount" and compared it to "count" each time and kept the bigger one, also reset "count" to zero everytime.

Searched how to implement the fopen fscanf and fclosef and used them instead of just the variables.

Added the time function.

bandit0: well pretty self explanatory
bandit1: ls to see the name of the file cat and the name to read it
bandit2: ls to see the name of the file then cat./ and the name to read it
bandit3: ls to see the name of the file then cat the name and in between a space and a "\" to read it
bandit4: ls to see the directory, cd to go to it, ls -a to see the hidden file and cat with the dot in front to read the file
bandit5: ls to see the dir, cd, ls to see the files, and try all of them with cat
bandit6: ls to see the dir, find with the parameters to see where the file I am looking for is, mistake the .file for the -file xD and then actually navigating to the correct one
